# 👋 Hi, I'm Alif Shiddiq Ramadhan

🎯 **QA Engineer | Test Automation Enthusiast | Passionate about Product Quality**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an experienced QA Engineer with a focus on manual and automated testing. I specialize in building robust test frameworks using **Playwright**, **Cypress**, and **WebdriverIO**, and I've worked across domains such as **travel**, **e-commerce**, **blockchain/NFTs**, and exploring **AI**.

💬 I care deeply about product quality and user experience — I believe great QA is the key to stable, scalable, and user-loved software.
